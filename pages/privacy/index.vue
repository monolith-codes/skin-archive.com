        <h4>
          We use two services from the US. Cloudflare is necessary for our
          service to work globally. For that we need to pass data to cloudflare
          us servers. Google Ads (US) also may get data from you. All EU users
          of our service are aked to accept it. Otherwise our service is not
          usable in the EU.

        <h2>Third Party Addons</h2>

        <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>
          This website uses services from "Cloudflare" (provider: Cloudflare,
          Inc., 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). Cloudflare
          operates a content delivery network (CDN) and provides protection
          functions for the website (web application firewall). The data
          transfer between your browser and our servers flows through
          Cloudflare's infrastructure and is analyzed there to prevent attacks.
          Cloudflare uses cookies for this purpose to enable you to access our
          website. The use of Cloudflare is in the interest of a safe use of our
          Internet presence and the defense of harmful attacks from the outside.
          For more information, please see the Cloudflare privacy policy:

        <h3>Google Ads</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>
          The website operator uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online
          advertising program of Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon
          House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Ads enables us to play
          advertisements in the Google search engine or on third-party websites
          when the user enters certain search terms on Google (keyword
          targeting). Furthermore, targeted advertisements can be played on the
          basis of user data available at Google (e.g. location data and
          interests) (target group targeting). As the website operator, we can
          evaluate this data quantitatively by analyzing, for example, which
          search terms led to the display of our ads and how many ads resulted
          in corresponding clicks. The use of this service is based on your
          consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO and § 25 para.
          1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. Data transfer to the
          USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission.
